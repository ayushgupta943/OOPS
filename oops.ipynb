        "    -   OOP is a way of writing code where we create objects that are like real things.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Each object has:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Data (like name, color, age)\n",

        "  -  A class is a blueprint or design to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is a real thing made from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If a class is the blueprint, then the object is the actual product built using that blueprint.\n",

        "  - Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Definition: Hides the complex implementation and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Purpose: To reduce complexity and increase simplicity for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. How in Python: Achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods (abc module).\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. Focus: On what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "   5. Example: You call .make_sound() on an animal, but you don’t know how it works inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Definition: Bundles data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Purpose: To protect data from accidental modification or misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. How in Python: Achieved using private (__var) and protected (_var) members.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. Focus: On how the data is protected and accessed.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Dunder methods (short for \"Double UNDerscore\") are special methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names, like:\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP where a child class (also called a subclass) can inherit properties and methods from a parent class (superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "    It allows code reusability, extensibility, and helps create a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism means \"many forms\" — it allows the same function name or operator to behave differently based on the object that is calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1.  Creating classes that wrap (bind) data and methods together.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Restricting direct access to variables by using access modifiers (like private/protected).\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. Providing public methods (getters/setters) to control access to private data.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method used to automatically initialize an object when it is created from a class.\n",

        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " -   Class Method (@classmethod):\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class, not instance).\n",

        "                  pass\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Static Method (@staticmethod):\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Does not take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",

        "\n",
        "    4. Used for utility functions related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Syntax:\n",

        "                 pass\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Method Overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type).\n",
        "\n",
        "  But in Python:\n",
        "    \n",
        "  Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Instead, you can simulate overloading using:\n",
        "\n",
        "  -   Default arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Variable arguments (*args, **kwargs)\n",
        "\n",
        "  -   Type checking inside the method\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOps?\n",
        "  - Method Overriding is a feature of inheritance in OOP where a child class provides a new implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class with the same name, parameters, and return type.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, the @property decorator is used to define a method as a property, allowing you to access it like an attribute (without parentheses), while still using method logic behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  -  Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used to define a common interface for its subclasses. It may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "  Modularity\n",
        "  → Code is organized into classes and objects, making it modular and manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Reusability\n",
        "  → Inheritance allows you to reuse existing code in new classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Encapsulation\n",
        "  → Data and functions are bundled together, and internal details are hidden from the outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism\n",
        "  → One interface can be used for different underlying forms (methods/functions), improving flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Maintainability\n",
        "  → OOP code is easier to update, debug, and extend due to its organized structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Scalability\n",
        "  → Large and complex systems can be easily scaled using OOP principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data Security\n",
        "  → Access modifiers (like private, protected) restrict direct access to object data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Real-World Modeling\n",
        "  → Objects represent real-world entities, making code easier to understand and design\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - Class Variable:\n",
        "    \n",
        "   1. Shared among all instances of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Defined inside the class but outside any method.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. Changing it affects all objects of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. Accessed using ClassName.variable_name or instance.variable_name.\n",
        "\n",
        "   5. Used for common data across all objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Instance Variable:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    1. Unique to each object (instance).\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Defined inside methods, usually __init__(), using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Changing it affects only that specific object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. Accessed using self.variable_name.\n",
        "\n",
        "    5. Used for object-specific data.\n",
        "\n",

        "  -  Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",

        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function is used to call methods from a parent (super) class in a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "        class Parent:\n",

        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It is used to perform cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources before the object is deleted.\n",

        " - @staticmethod\n",

        "  - Polymorphism in Python allows different classes to define methods with the same name, and the correct method is called based on the object’s class, especially when using inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How it works with Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        " - When a child class overrides a method from the parent class, and the method is called using a parent class reference, Python will execute the child class's version of the method.\n",
